A text-based RPG inspired by the game Runescape.

The program lets the player level up there character by gaining experience points from fighting randomly generated monsters. These monsters also drop rare items that the character can equip to increase their max hit. Players can equip and unequip items / armor. The game also has a general store where the user can sell and buy items. This game was created to refresh my object oriented programming skills in 2016.
